# FE595_HW3
HW3.py is a file that compiles all scripts for one-time use.

There are 3 seperated scripts:

1. The first script is called "wrap_business". 
The purpose of this function is to split business names and business purposes into two different lists.
One output list is called “name” which includes all business names and the other one is called “purpose” which includes all business purposes.
The input is the variable by using “open” function. It is a TexIOWrapper result. The output type is a tuple.
The file in this part all my local files and users can use their own local files to complete the code.

2. The second script is called “score”. It is to output the best and worst business purposes and their sentiment score by using sentiment sorting vader.
The only one input variable is a string list. 
Generally, it is “purpose” from the tuple generated from the first script. 
The output is generated through print function.

3. The third script is called “get_tokens”. 
It is to output 10 most common words/tokens. 
The input is the same as that in the second script and the output type is same, too.

For more questions, please comment under the code.
